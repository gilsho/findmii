Please read the course project webpage, the information session slides  and
all comments in the ".m" files and ".cpp" files carefully. If you have any
question, please post them on Piazza.

Steps to building:
1) Copy the sample code from the findMii directory to your local directory. The datafiles can stay in the class directory, just be sure to update your references.

2) You MUST run the following command before you can make and run your programs: 
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /afs/ir/class/cs231a/opencv/lib

3) Modify the Makefile to build your target *.CPP files.

4) Type "make" at the command prompt.
